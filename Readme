# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

This project demonstrates an advanced fraud detection system using both unsupervised and supervised techniques. The goal is to detect unusual patterns in transactional data by combining:
- **Unsupervised learning:** Autoencoder for anomaly detection.
- **Supervised learning:** Ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest) for fraud classification.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from raw data to improve model performance.
